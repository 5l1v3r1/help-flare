In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
